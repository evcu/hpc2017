# Spring 2017: Advanced Topics in Numerical Analysis: High Performance Computing Assignment 2

## To run the code
- Run `make`. This will compile the bug-sources and the omp-implementations of jacobi and gauss-siedel smoothing. 
- Run `make no-omp`. This will compile 2d jacobi and gauss-siedel smoothing without openmp flag. 

## Timings 
Timings are generated on HPC Mercer with  `/report/timingScript.sh` and printed out into results.out

## Timing Plots for Different N*N matrices
